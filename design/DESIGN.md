# Team Watch — design mock

Four surfaces, one console:

| # | Surface | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | My teams | What moved on my two rosters, and what do I do about it |
| 02 | The pool | Which player anywhere in the league is taking over a role |
| 03 | Parlay | Which of the model's best slips do I take, or what do I build myself |
| 04 | DFS | Which precomputed lineup do I load, or what do I build myself |

Build after editing anything under `design/src/`:

```
python design/build.py
```

## Live data in, live signals on top

`build.py` reads the real roster files from `ff-jarvis` and injects them:

| Source | Injected as | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `data/espn_rosters.json` | `LIVE_ESPN` | name, pos, team, **lineup slot**, injury status |
| `data/league_rosters.json` | `LIVE_YAHOO` | name, pos, team — **no slot, no status** |

The Yahoo file comes from a website scrape, so lineup slots are inferred by filling the league
lineup in roster order. The board says so in a caption rather than passing the guess off as fact.

A roster row's Trend, Rank and News cells come from `data/signals.js` (since 2026-09-16; the
hand-typed `SIGNALS` map is gone). Nothing is typed by hand:

| Cell | Source | Shows from |
|---|---|---|
| Trend line | `watch.json` `series`, weekly snap % (`LIVE_SIGNALS`) | week 2: a line needs two weeks |
| Trend delta | `market.stock` `d_pts`, points vs his previous game's price | a priced prop market |
| Rank | `market.stock` `rank`/`d_rank`, position rank among priced players | a priced prop market |
| Verdict tag | `watch.json` `verdict`, hidden for NEW and hold | week 2 |
| News | scanner stories whose headline starts with his name, team agreeing, last 72 h | now |

None of the three sources is backtested. The verdict word is watch's own; the page adds none.

## Waivers (sub-tab of My Teams, 2026-09-16)

A Roster | Waivers toggle under the team name, not a sixth nav tab: waivers are per league like
the roster, so the league switch carries over, and the phone's bottom bar keeps five thumb-sized
columns. The data is ff-jarvis's `model.season.waiver_packet`, built daily by the refresh
(`LIVE_WAIVER`, `design/waiver.py`), and the tab only formats it.

**Cards since 2026-09-22** (superseding the rows, Suggested moves and drops list). One card per
candidate across both leagues, tiered by ff-jarvis: Must claim (all), Worth a claim (top 5),
Watch (top 5), Speculative and Stash folded shut. On a Tuesday (local) an empty hash opens
Waivers and Waivers leads My teams.

| Part | Shows | Source field |
|---|---|---|
| Hero line | clear time, must-claims open in this league, FAAB left | `leagues_meta[league]` |
| Headline | the best swap across his open leagues, else the need he fills | `leagues[*].verdict`, `need` |
| Summary | two sentences; a RULE mark when the LLM text failed its fact check | `summary.src` |
| Proof | 3 stats by position, rank that week, arrow vs the week before | the usage grid (`LIVE_USAGE`) |
| League rows | status, verdict, drop, margin, per league he is available in | `leagues[*]`, in `leagues_meta` order |

## The pool

Ranked on usage, never points. The anchor is a quadrant scatter: **x = change in snap/target
share, y = points still owed (luck, sign flipped).** The four corners are the whole product.
Since 2026-09-16 it reads the usual way, best top-right to worst bottom-left; plotting luck itself
put the sells on top and the cloud read as an upside-down V.

| Quadrant | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| upper right (green wash) | role growing, points not caught up | **buy low** |
| lower right | role and box score agree | confirmed, hold |
| upper left | role shrinking, points were unlucky anyway | fade |
| lower left (red wash) | points ran ahead of a shrinking role | sell high |

**Live since 2026-09-17** (`LIVE_POOL`, `design/pool.py`): watch.json's league-wide pool, every
back and quarterback with 8+ opportunities and every receiver with 4+ (171 players in week 1; one
floor of 8 kept only 22 WRs and 5 TEs). The share a row shows is the one watch's verdict reads (carries for a
back, targets for a receiver or tight end, snaps for a quarterback), ranked by that share with
quarterbacks last. "Free in" comes from watch's `rostered_by`: Mine, Both, ESPN, Yahoo, or a dash.
Share moves need two weeks, so through week 1 the chart says when it fills in rather than plotting
nothing. The 16 hand-typed rows in `data/pool.js` are only the fallback when watch.json is missing.

Dot size is snaps. A lime ring means he is on one of my rosters. Table below repeats it as rows
so the numbers are readable, paginated 10 at a time (2026-09-09) once real usage data makes the
list run long — the sample data's 16 fits on two pages.

On mobile (2026-09-09) the chart draws to a taller, narrower geometry sized close to 1:1 with the
actual screen instead of the desktop box scaled down to ~35% (which is what forced a horizontal
swipe to read anything). Per-dot name labels drop at that size — 16 of them collide regardless of
box shape, and the table right below already names every player — dots stay tappable into the
same drawer. Quadrant corner labels shortened to one word each (`CONFIRMED`, `SELL HIGH`, `BUY
LOW`, `FADING`) at both sizes, the explanatory phrase folded into the intro line instead.

## Parlay and DFS

Split into their own top-level tabs (2026-09-09) so the cart, not the 900-row props pool, is the
first thing a mobile reader reaches. Each tab: a collapsed-by-default "how this works" banner,
a gallery of the model's precomputed picks, then the cart-style custom builder, then the pool.

**Parlay**: a Book toggle (2026-09-09, DraftKings/Underdog, same pattern as DFS's site toggle)
switches the gallery, pool rows, and cart between two different products, not just a price
column. **DraftKings**: one gallery card per kickoff window (never two calendar dates in one card
— `design/build.py`'s `assign_windows` splits a time-of-day bucket like "evening" into
per-weekday windows, e.g. "Thursday Night" / "Monday Night", when the week's games land on more
than one date) crossed with yards / TDs / mix scope, ranked by model edge, the best one badged.
Model %/edge and every book's price live behind each line's chevron, not on the row.
**Underdog**: pick'em, one stat and one tap — the row leads with the model's higher/lower call
and its confidence (that IS the primary info here, not noise the way DK's model%/edge is; Higher
green, Lower red, the same up/down tokens as everywhere else), a same set of gallery cards built
from Underdog-eligible legs (conf ≥ 58%) instead of DK edge, ranked by confidence. Underdog
carries no anytime-TD price in this feed at all (checked 2026-09-10: 0 of 430 TD rows), so a TD
pick derives from the model's own chance of scoring instead — tagged `MODEL` on the row and in
the cart's footer caption, never shown as an Underdog price. Switching the toggle clears the cart
(a leg's meaning doesn't carry across books). Either way: load a card into the cart or tap lines
by hand; the cart warns when two legs
share a game (correlated legs are one bet, not two).

**DFS**: a swipeable rail of precomputed lineups per strategy (an equal-width segmented control,
greedy = max points, non-chalk = for GPPs) each with a "Load into my lineup" button, then nine
cart slots against a cap, salary bar, summed ownership, and a styled empty slot — a second toggle
picks Yahoo ($200 cap, live from ff-jarvis's `data/dfs_pool.json`) or DraftKings ($50,000 cap,
sample). The cart is configurable (2026-09-09): tap a vacant slot to fill it or a filled one to
swap it, tap a pool row to add/assign (auto-picks the first open eligible slot when none is
selected), an "✕" removes. A wrong-position pick is rejected inline (`Josh is RB, not QB`) rather
than silently doing nothing.

The topbar's live/sample badge (2026-09-09) reflects what's actually loaded per tab instead of a
single static "Sample data" string: green "Props live" / "Pool live" when Parlay's BettingPros
props or DFS's Yahoo salary export are in, the amber sample warning otherwise. My Teams goes
green when `LIVE_SIGNALS` is in (2026-09-16); the Waivers sub-tab is live from the same day.

## Motion (2026-09-16)

Motion marks a change of context, never moves what is being read. All of it lives in
`css/chrome/motion.css` and `js/chrome/motion.js`, and all of it is off under reduced motion.

| Moment | Motion |
|---|---|
| Team switch | a football crosses the hero; the team name is one line, fitted, so the hero height holds |
| Tab or sub-tab switch | the `//` in TEAM//WATCH crosses into an X and back |
| Waivers, news list | rows arrive one at a time |

## News severity (2026-09-16)

FantasyPros tags almost no story, so `design/news.py` reads each headline into a `kind`: **out**
(red), **injury** (amber: questionable, a missed practice, a named hamstring/concussion-class
injury), **practice** (routine: limited, full, rest day, cleared), **move**, **other**. The kind leads
every row as an icon and a word, and the filters are the kinds. "How this works" on Parlay and DFS
is a small button in the hero that opens the drawer.

## Direction

Signal Desk — a dark trading-terminal console.

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| lime `#c8ff2e` | active, starter, buy-low, brand |
| green `#37e08b` | trending up, confirmed |
| red `#ff5a52` | trending down, sell |
| amber `#ffb020` | caution, stale, correlated legs |
| violet / red marks | Yahoo / ESPN league identity only |

Positions are typographic, never coloured, with one exception decided 2026-09-21: the profile
modal's stat sheet (radar, its chips, the stat card) is tinted by position (`--pos-qb/rb/wr/te`),
so a run of profiles reads QB/RB/WR/TE at a glance. Rows, cells and badges stay typographic.
Type: Bricolage Grotesque (display), Archivo (UI),
JetBrains Mono (all numerals).

## Theme rules

`design/lint_css.py` fails the build on any of these (`python design/lint_css.py`):

- `hex-outside-tokens` — a colour literal anywhere but `base/tokens.css`.
- `rgba-token-triple` — `rgba(r,g,b,…)` spelling out a token's own channels by hand.
- `token-triple-agrees` — a token's `--x-rgb` triple must match its `--x` hex, and a hex token
  without a triple is an error too.
- `font-family-literal` — a `font-family` value that isn't a `var()`.
- `font-size-literal` — a `font-size` that isn't a step of the type scale (`--t-1` 12px through
  `--t-7` 40px, plus the hero's two ghost sizes) in `base/base.css`. Added 2026-09-21, when 217
  literals from 9px to 38px moved onto the scale in one pass; 12px is the floor.
- `breakpoint` — a `@media` width outside the three the page uses (960/760/430).
- `inline-colour-in-js` — a colour literal inside a `style=""` in the JS or the shell. Styling
  belongs in a class; the JS names the class.
- `duplicate-selector` — the same selector defined in two non-responsive parts. Either the
  override is deliberate and `src/css/_overrides.txt` says so, or the rule lives in one part.

Every colour token in `base/tokens.css` carries a channel triple next to it, e.g.
`--lime:#c8ff2e; --lime-rgb:200 255 46;`. `rgba()` needs bare channels, so a translucent lime
is `rgb(var(--lime-rgb) / .4)`, never `rgba(200,255,46,.4)`. A new colour means a new token plus
its triple in `base/tokens.css` — never a literal dropped into a component file.

**Spacing is px-literal, on purpose (decided 2026-09-10).** A spacing scale was considered and
rejected on the numbers: 397 px literals across 375 spacing declarations, and every integer from
1 to 16 is in regular use (14px appears 38 times, 7px 21, 9px 24, 11px 18). No 4px or 8px scale
covers more than 40% of them; moving the rest onto a scale is a visual redesign of a dense data
console, not a refactor. If a scale is ever wanted it is its own project with its own golden
diff. Colour, type and motion are tokens; spacing is not.

## States already styled

In-place variants: filtered-list and empty-cart empty states, the scatter's no-data axes,
`No data` trend chips, unranked players, and an empty DFS slot. The standalone "Component
states" showcase (empty/loading/error/stale reference boxes) was removed 2026-09-09 — it was
permanent staged content on the live page, not a real state, and read as dead/leftover UI to a
visitor. Loading/error/stale are still designed (see `.pill.warn`, `marketHead`'s no-fetch
pill), just not demonstrated in a standing block.

## Verified 2026-09-09

Desktop 1400px and phone 390px, no horizontal overflow on any of the four surfaces, no console
errors. Gallery/rail interactions checked headless: loading a gallery card or a strategy lineup
into the cart, expanding a leg's chevron without toggling it into the slip, tapping inside the
expanded detail without toggling it, the explainer's open state surviving a pagination re-render.
Rosters and team names are live. Trend, rank, news, pool, props and DFS content are sample.
